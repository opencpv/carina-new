## **Introduction**

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) that uses Ethereum smart contracts to streamline the insurance claims process. Built on Scaffold-ETH, the application leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and automated claim submissions, verifications, and payments.

## **Features**

- **Semi Automated Claim Processing:** Smart contracts handle the submission, verification, and approval is done by an agent of the insurance.
- **Fraud Detection:** Built-in mechanisms to detect and flag potentially fraudulent claims.
- **Social Verification:** Integration with Circles for decentralized social trust verification.
- **Real-Time Data:** Use of The Graph for indexing and querying blockchain data in real-time.
- **Secure Payments:** Automatic and secure payments via smart contracts upon claim approval.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** (v6.x or later) or **yarn**
- **Git**
- **Metamask** or other Web3 wallets
- **Scaffold-ETH** (You can clone the [Scaffold-ETH repository](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth))

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-claims-dapp.git
   cd insurance-claims-dapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Environment:**

   Scaffold-ETH provides a powerful development environment. Run:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   This command will start the local blockchain, deploy the contracts, and open the React frontend.

### **Running the Application**

1. **Deploy Smart Contracts:**

   Ensure your local blockchain is running and deploy your contracts:

   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```

2. **Run Frontend:**

   The frontend is built using React and connects to your smart contracts via Scaffold-ETH:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

3. **Access the App:**

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## **Smart Contracts**

This project uses Solidity to define smart contracts for handling insurance claims:

- **ClaimContract.sol**: Manages the submission, verification, and payment of claims.
- **InsurancePolicy.sol**: Tracks the policies and their associated terms.

Contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and can be extended or modified based on your requirements.

## **The Graph Integration**

The Graph is used for indexing and querying blockchain data:

1. **Subgraph Development:**

   Create and deploy subgraphs for efficient querying of data related to claims and policies.

2. **Querying Data:**

   Use GraphQL to retrieve real-time data for the frontend.

## **Circles Integration**

Circles is used for social verification of claims:

- **Trust Network:** Verify claims through a decentralized social trust network.
- **Integration:** Integrate Circles API for validating claim legitimacy based on social trust scores.

## **Project Structure**

- **/contracts**: Solidity smart contracts.
- **/frontend**: React frontend code.
- **/subgraph**: Subgraph definitions for The Graph.
- **/scripts**: Deployment and utility scripts.

## **Usage**

1. **Register:**

   Users can register on the platform by providing necessary personal, insurance, and verification details.

2. **Submit Claims:**

   Users can submit claims for healthcare services, which are then processed by the smart contracts.

3. **Monitor Claims:**

   Users can monitor the status of their claims, including verification and payment stages.

4. **Social Verification:**

   Claims are verified through Circles before final approval, ensuring trust and legitimacy.
